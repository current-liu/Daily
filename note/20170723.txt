# No tests were found 
最后发现，书上说除了测试类外，要使用

unittest.main() 
来让python运行这个文件夹中的测试。而在PyCharm中，如果这样写就会出现上述问题。当把这条改成

unittest.main

也就是去掉括号后，测试会正常运行。

# Creating Tests #
PyCharm suggests a way to create tests for classes and individual methods.

To create a test for a class or method, follow these general steps

In the editor, place the caret at the class declaration, or somewhere within a method. 

Do one of the following: 

On the main menu, choose Navigate | Test. 

On the context menu, choose Go To | Test. 

PyCharm shows the list of available tests. 

If the desired test doesn’t yet exist, click Create new test. 

The Create Test dialog box opens. 

In the Create Test dialog box, specify the following settings: 

Target directory, where the new test class will be generated. 

The name of the test file, and the name of the test class. 

Select the check boxes next to the methods you want to include in the test class. 

Note that if the caret has been placed within a method, only this method name is included in the list. 

Click OK when ready. PyCharm generates the test file in the specified location.
